      In nature, <em class="good">Good</em> & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither good
      nor bad, but a potential in permanent development. In life, there are 4 types of people.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        people who think the Internet is good,
      </li>
      <li>
        people who think the Internet is evil,
      </li>
      <li>
        people who think the Internet is cats,
      </li>
      <li>
        people who don't think about it.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars
      or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not
      serious, and there’s no such thing as an issue. Down here, the only reality is the one inside
      our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our senses
      don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality changes. That’s
      possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we
      mis translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes
      depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.
      They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull
      yourself out of that grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or
      herself differently. But the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works
      like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his
        neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run
        away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.” The
        next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening
        everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
        have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.” The
        following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown
        and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer
        responded, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.” The next day the conscription officers
        came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
        broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he
        said, “Is it good? Is it bad? I don't know.” The whole process of nature is an integrated
        process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
        happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

      Here is this dialog in the form of a table
    </p>

    <table>
      <caption>
        Table representing the farmer's philosophy.

      <tr>

    <h2>
      Conclusion
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are
      good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
